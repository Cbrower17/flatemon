Welcome to Flatemon

This project is an introduction to sql using python and sqlite. To make it fun
for myself I thought it would be cool to use another bit of new tech being pygame.

In the project I want to make a game that you can walk around in and engage with npc and encounter wild "pokemon". The primary goal is to get familiar with sql as well gain experience designing a database schema.

To run program 
open in a terminal and run:
    pipenv install
after the that is done run the main.py file
