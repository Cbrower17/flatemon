Welcome to Flatemon

This project is an introduction to sql tables using python and sqlite. To make it fun
for myself I thought it would be cool to use another new piece of of new tech being pygame.

In the project I want to make a game that you can walk around in and engage with npc and encounter wild "pokemon". The primary goal is to get familiar with sql as well gain experience designing a daabase schema.
